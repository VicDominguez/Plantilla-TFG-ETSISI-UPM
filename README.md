## 🤔 What is this project?

This project is a Latex template to write a Final Degree project, aimed to ETSISI-UPM (School of Computer Systems Engineering, Polytechnic University of Madrid) students.

## 🎯 Key Features

* Double cover with logos on blue and white. First one is designed to be used as a cover of a hardcover book printing, while the second one is the default cover and  can be printed also as an internal one.

* Acknowledgements, summary and abstract sections have been implemented, together with their Roman numeral numbering.

* Index, table index and image index already created and renamed.

* Separation into .tex files to improve writing and review process.

* Usual packages already loaded, such as _spanish_, _minted_ (for the incorporation of code) and _graphicx_, among others.

* Finally, some photos ([cover](demo/ejemplo_portada_libro_impreso.jpg), [source code](demo/ejemplo_codigo_impreso.jpg)) are provided to check how it looks on real life.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Template can be used out-of-the-box on enviroments like Overleaf or local Latex enviroments, like [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) on VSCode.

A compiled example can be found [here](demo/demo.pdf), while an example of annex with source code can be found [here](demo/anexo_codigo.jpg).
